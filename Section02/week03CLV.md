Simple Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) <br>

```ruby

CLV = AvTransactionPerMonth*AvOrderValue*AvGrossMargin*AvCustomerLifespanInMonths

## Example ###
  AvTransactionPerMonth = Total_transaction(6months)/Period(6months)
  AvOrderValue = Total_Revenue(July)/Number_of_orders(July)
  AvGrossMargin = ( ( Total_Revenue(July)-Discounts(July) )/Total_Revenue(July) )*100

  AvCustomerLifespanInMonths = 1/Churn_Rate

## Note ##
  Churn_Rate = ( (Number_of_customer_at_begining_July)-(Number_of_customer_at_the_end_July) )/(Number_of_customer_at_begining_July)

```
